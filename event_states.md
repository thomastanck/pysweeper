On an event related to the cursor, there is an event.state flag, which by experimentation seems to corresponds to the following values. I cannot find documentation of this.

shift = 1
capslock = 2
ctrl = 4
alt = 8
numlock = 16

windows_key = 64

left_button = 256
middle_button = 512
right_button = 1024
